## Visualizing Differential Equations
 - In order to visualize a differential equation, a directional field, consisting of arrows in a field, can be used
 - Each arrow describes how a sepecific point will change over time
#### Construction
- In order to construct a vector field, a few steps are required 
###### Nullclines
- Nullclines are linear lines, at which a differential equation equals zero 
- Those nullclines can be thought of as the axes of directional fields

###### Steady States
- Steady states are the intersections of nullclines
- Directional fields, in a certain sense, exist only to identify steady states as either attractive, repulsive, or saddle points

###### Considering Signs
- The direction of arrows depends on the sign of a differential equation in a sector
- These sectors are defined by the nullclines
- For each sector, the signs of all differential equations are combined

###### Construct Arrows
- Once the direction of arrows has been defined for every sector, they can be drawn
- It is important to consider the fact, that arrows might cross nullclines and don't have to be in line with them
