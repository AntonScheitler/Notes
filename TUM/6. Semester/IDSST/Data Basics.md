## Variables
- Variables can have different types and relations to one another
#### Types
- In general, variables can be numerical, i.e. represented as a number, or categorical, i.e. represented in any other way
- Furthermore, if there an ordering can be applied to a categorical variable, it is considered ordinal, otherwise it is a nominal variable
#### Relations
- In general, variables can either be associated or independent
###### Associative Variables
- If a variable might causally affect another, the first variable is considered an explanatory variable and the second is a response variable
- A variable is considered confounding if it influences both the explanatory and response variable to make it seem as if there's a causal relation between them
## Sampling
- When taking a sample from a population, one needs to account for possible biases
#### Biases
- The non-response bias describes the bias that only a fraction of the surveyed population may respond
- The voluntary response bias describes the bias that only people who have strong opinions on a topic may respond
#### Sampling Strategies 
- In a simple random sampling, a set of data points from the population is randomly selected
- In a stratified sampling, there are underlying categories to a population and it is split into stratas before random data points are taken from each of them
- In a cluster sampling, there is an inhomogenous observation and a random sample of clusters is selected, where all datapoints of a cluster end up in the dataset
- A multistage sampling functions exactly like a cluster sampling, except only a subset of all datapoints of a cluster end up in the dataset
## Observations and Experiments
- When collecting data, one can distinguish observations and experiments
#### Observation
- In an observation, the act of collecting data does not directly interfere with how the data actually arises
#### Experiment
- In an experiment, samples of a population are treated differently in an aritificial setting in order to establish a connection between some explanatory and response variable
###### Principles
- Experiments should be controlled, meaning there must be some treatment and control group
- They must be randomized, meaning that subjects are randomly assigned to each group
- Ideally experiments should be replicated and executed multiple times
- If there are distinctive features between subjects, they should be assigned to blocks accordingly, before randomly assigning subjects from each block to the treament or control group
