## Hypothesis Testing
- In order to make draw conclusions from data, hypotheses need to be made
#### Procedure
- In general, we make a null hypothesis $H_0$, which states that there is nothing to be gained from the data and any observed correlation is coincidence
- Under the assumption that $H_0$ is true we then compute some summary statistic $T(X)$ of our data and check how likely it is that it can even occur
- If there's enough evidence that the observed $T(X)$ is not a coincidence, we can reject $H_0$, otherwise, we assume $H_0$ holds
